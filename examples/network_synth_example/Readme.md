# Network Synthesis Example
This example shows why network synthesis for task scheduling must consider how the scheduling algorithm performs on the synthesized network.
In particular, the example shows how strictly *improving* the network can *degrade* the performance of the scheduling algorithm.
This example is used in Section 5.1 of the thesis [Dispersed Computing in Dynamic Environments](https://www.proquest.com/docview/3056588562/26E37111A4AA4CF2PQ/2).
