# Dynamic Scheduling Example

Example that shows how the network changing can greatly affect the quality of a scheduler.
In this example, HEFT produces a better schedule for the initial network than the one produced by CPoP.
Adjusting the network slightly though (by decreasing the link strength between node $3$ and other nodes), causes CPoP to produce a better schedule than HEFT.
