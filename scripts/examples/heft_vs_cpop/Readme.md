# HEFT vs. CPoP
This example shows a problem instance where CPoP outperforms HEFT and another problem instance where HEFT outperforms CPoP.
This example shows how an algorithm that performs very well for some problem instances can perform poorly for others, one of the common themes in the paper [Comparing Task Graph Scheduling Algorithms: An Adversarial Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07120).
