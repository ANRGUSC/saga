# HEFT vs. CPoP Family
Using the results from the example [HEFT vs. CPoP](../heft_vs_cpop/Readme.md), we can create a family of problem instances where CPoP outperforms HEFT and another family of problem instances where HEFT outperforms CPoP.
This example shows how the results from adversarial analysis (PISA) can be used to understand what *types* of problem instances an algorithm performs well on.
