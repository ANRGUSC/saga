# PISA Experiments

To run the PISA experiments from the paper [Comparing Task Graph Scheduling Algorithms: An Adversarial Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07120), run the following command:
```bash
python run.py      # Run the experiments
python analyze.py   # Analyze the results
```
This will save the experimental data in the `./results` directory and generate the plots in the `./output` directory.

You can also open the `./explore_results.ipynb` Jupyter notebook to interactively explore the results for different pairs of scheduling algorithms.
