# PISA Experiments

To run the PISA experiments from the paper [Comparing Task Graph Scheduling Algorithms: An Adversarial Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07120), run the following command:
```bash
python main.py      # Run the experiments
python analyze.py   # Analyze the results
```
This will save the experimental data in the `./results` directory and generate the plots in the `./output` directory.
