# PISA Experiments

To run the PISA experiments from the paper [REMOVED FOR ANONYMITY], run the following command:
```bash
python main.py      # Run the experiments
python analyze.py   # Analyze the results
```
This will save the experimental data in the `./results` directory and generate the plots in the `./output` directory.
